##Types of Data Science Questions
### In approximate order of difficulty
* Descriptive
* Exploratory
* Inferential
* Predictive
* Casual
* Mechanistic

## Descriptive
Goal - Desrcibe a set of data
* The first kind of analysis performed
* Commonly applied to census data
* Descrition and Interpretation of this data are two different steps
* Descriptions usually can not be generalized without additional statistical modeling - 
  in other words you are describing what you see in data but cannot predict about other records
Example - Google Ngram

## Exploratory
Goal - Find relationships you didn't know about
* Exploraory models are good for discovering new connections
* Useful for defining future studies
* Usually not the final say
* Exploratory analysis alone should not be used for generalization/prediction
* Correlation does not imply causation

## Inferential
Goal - Use a smaller set of data to extrapolate/generalize to a bigger population
* Inference is commonly the goal of statistical models
* Inference involves estimating both the quantity you care about and your uncertainity about the estimate
* Inference relies heavily on both the population and the sampling scheme

## Predictive
Goal - To use data on some objects to predict values for another object
* If X predicts Y it does not mean that X causes Y
* Accurate prediction depends heavily on meausing the right variables
* Although there are better and worse prediction models, more data and simple models work really well
* Prediction is very hardr, specially about future reference

## Casual
Goal - To find out what happens to one variable when you change another
* Usually randomized studies are required to identify casuation
* There are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomized studies, but they are complicated and sensitive to assumptions
* Casual relationships are usually identified as average effects, but may not apply to every individual
* Casual models are usually the "gold standard" for data analysis

## Mechanistic  - Very rarely used in Data Science
Goal - Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in another variables for individual objects
* Incredibly hard to infer, except in simple situations
* Usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations (physical/engineering science)
* Generally the random component of data is measurement error
* If the equations are known but parameters are not, they may be inferred by data analysis

# Data
* Question is the most important thing in data science
* Data is the second most important factor
* Often the data will limit or enable teh question
* But having data cant save you if you dont have the question
